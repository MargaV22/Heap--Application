# Emergency Room Queue Management System

INTRODUCTION 

The Emergency Room Queue Management System is a console-based application built in Java that uses a Max-Heap structure to manage patients in an emergency room. Patients with higher severity levels are prioritized over others.

WHAT IT CAN DO?

1. Add Patient: Users can add a patient by providing their name and severity level (1-10).
2. View Next Patient: Displays the patient with the highest severity (top priority).
 
3. Attend Next Patient: Removes the most severe patient's record from the queue after attending to them.

4. View All Patients: Lists all patients in the queue, displaying their names and severity levels.

5. Exit: Ends the application.

WHY THIS APPLICATION?

This application models a real-world scenario where priorities are crucial, such as in emergency rooms. It was created to:

1. Illustrate Max-Heap Usage: Demonstrate how a max-heap prioritizes data based on critical conditions.

2. Practical Use Case: Provide a real-world example of how data structures can solve problems in healthcare management.

3. Learning Tool: Allow Java learners to explore PriorityQueue for tasks requiring descending order priority.

Contribution to the Community

1. Healthcare Simulation: Offers a basic but realistic example of triage in emergency rooms.

2. Educational Value: Simplifies understanding of max-heaps and their practical applications.

3. Real-World Relevance: Inspires similar applications in fields like disaster management or customer service.
